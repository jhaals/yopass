2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact, and any suggested mitigations or remediations.
3. Allow a reasonable time for the Yopass maintainers to respond to your report and address the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it. We will keep you updated on our progress.
